some words were big, and some were very small.

but sometimes i could't see some of small letters.

the optometrist would cover one of my eyes while i read the charts.
then she would cover my other eye.
she even put some drops on my eyes.

and she laughed and said, it wasn't that kind of test you passed or failed.
she was just find out if i need a glasses.
