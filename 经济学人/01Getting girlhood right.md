Getting girlhood right
> `Girlhood` refers to the period of a girl's life from childhood to adulthood

It can also mean to understand something correctly or to make the right decision. For example, if someone asks you to do a task and you complete it successfully, you can say "I got it right" or "I got it right the first time" to indicate that you did it correctly.

example:
> "Getting girlhood right" means ensuring that girls receive the necessary care, support, and opportunities during their formative years so that they can reach their full potential and become independent, confident, and successful adults.

For much of human history and in many places, girls were considered property. Or, at best, subordinate people, `(who are)` required to obey their fathers until the day they had to start obeying their husbands. Few people thought it worthwhile to educate them. ==Even fewer imagined that a girl could grow up to govern Germany, run the IMF or invent a vaccine.==

> think it worthwhile to do something


In most of the world that vision of girlhood now seems ==not merely old-fashioned but unimaginably remote==. In much of the rich world parents now treat their daughters as well as they do their sons, and invest as much in their future. ==In field after field girls have caught up with boys==. ==Globally, young women now outnumber young men at university==. ==The speed of change has been blistering== . ==Fifty years ago only 49% of primaryschool-age girls in lower-middle-income countries were in school, compared with 71% of boys==; today the share of both is about 90%. In 1998 only half the world’s secondary-school-age girls were enrolled; today two-thirds are. Over the same period rates of illiteracy fell from one in five young women aged 15-24 to one in ten, bringing them roughly ==on a par with== young men.

Girl babies are more wanted than ever before. Parents in some countries prefer them. Even in places, such as China, ==where the sex-selective abortion of girl fetuses has been rife==, it is often be coming less so. Girls are also less likely to be married off in childhood. In 1995 almost six in ten girls in South Asia were hitched before reaching18; that ratio has fallen by half. Around the world, it has fallen from one in four to one in five.

Girls are healthier, too. ==Compared with the mid-1990s==, they become ==sexually active== later and are more likely to use contraception. Rates of teenage pregnancy have fallen by a quarter globally and by two-thirds in South Asia and North America. Girls are less likely to suffer female genital mutilation—and ==object to== this horrific tradition more vocally. Whereas in 2000 just 27% of women and girls in the most-affected regions said it should be banned, today 54% do.

> 1. sexually active : engaging in sexual relations.
> 2. vocally : to express opinions and complaints often


 ==When societies handle girlhood well, the knock-on effects are astounding==. A girl who finishes secondary school is less likely to become a child bride or a teenage mother. ==Education boosts earning power and widens choices, so she is less likely to be poor or to suffer domestic abuse. She will earn almost twice as much as a girl without schooling.==

> 2. astounding : very surprising and shocking.

And she will pass on a ==smorgasbord of advantages to her offspring==. She will have fewer children, and invest more in them. They will be less likely to die in infancy, or to grow up stunted physically or mentally. She will read to them more, and help them with their homework. All this means they will learn more, and earn more as adults. A recent study by Citigroup and Plan International estimated that, if a group of emerging economies ensured that 100% of their girls completed secondary school, it could ==lead to== a lasting boost to their GDP of 10% by 2030. 

> 1. ==smorgasbord of advantages to her offspring== : mixture of advantages to her futures.

Because the benefits of ==nurturing== girls are so large, ==it is a scandal that some countries have still failed to grasp them==. Less than half the girls in South Asia, the Middle East or Africa ==have access to== the contraception that they may want. Only one girl in three south of the Sahara finishes her secondary education. And although rates of child marriage have fallen by half in South Asia, they have fallen by less than that in Africa (which now has the highest rate in the world) and have remained stagnant in Latin America and the Caribbean.

> 1. nurtuing : take care of 
> 2. grasp :  understand or take in 
> 3. have access to : have a way to , 
> 4. stagnant : not growing or developing. 

The covid-19 pandemic ==could hobble progress for girls in poor countries, or even reverse it==. During previous disasters, they have often suffered most. When Ebola forced west African schools to close in 2014, ==many girls dropped out, never went back and ended up pregnant or as child labourers==. UNICEF warns that something similar could happen with covid-19—but on a larger scale. Studies suggest that in the next decade 13m child marriages that would have been ==averted== may go ahead, and an extra 2m girls may have their genitals cut. 

> 1. hobble : to limit something or control the freedom of someone.
> 2. If girls can't finish education, they will end up pregnant or as child labourers. This is not girl's fault, this is society's  fault. 
> 3. averted : to prevent something bad happen.

The risk of ==regression== is real. So it is crucial that, even if governments of poor countries have to ==tighten their belts==, they ==prioritise== spending on education and girls. Donors should help, too. And policies should be joined up. Persuading girls to stay in school longer is not only a way to teach them maths; it is also a chance to ==vaccinate== them and teach them about birth control, consent and ==self-assertion==. It can even be an opportunity to advise parents about the downsides of child marriage.

> 1. regression : a return to a former or less developed state.
> 2. consent : permission or agreement. 
> 3. vaccinate : to give someone a vaccine, usually by injection, to prevent them from getting a disease
> 4. self-assertion : the act of giving your opinions in a powerful way so that other people will notice, or an example of this
> 5. advise sb about sth : **to give someone information about something**

 ==Adolescence is a crucial juncture for girls==. It is when many health problems emerge or are averted; and many social ones, too, ==from truancy to self-harm==. Only recently has this phase been recognised as the most important for brain development after infancy. Get it right and ==billions of girls will have a better shot at fulfilling their potential==. Get it wrong and they will live poorer, shorter lives, less able to ==stand up for== themselves, more vulnerable to coercion, and more likely to pass these disadvantages on to the next generation. So, get girlhood right.
