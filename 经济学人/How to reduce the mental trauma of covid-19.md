How to reduce the mental trauma of covid-19

> trauma
>  severe emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience

In Ecuador people are still searching for the bodies of relatives who died of covid-19 four month ago. In  Italy a boy begged a priest to forgive the "sin" of lowering his face mask outdoors. ==Not since the second world war have so many people in so many places been traumatised at once.== Even after the disease itself is ==brought under control==, the mental scars will linger.

> Not since the second world war have so many people in so many places been traumatised at once:
> means that 
> After the second world war,  there is no accident which make many people


> "Not since" is a phrase used to indicate that something has not happened or occurred again after a specific point or event in the past. It emphasizes the length of time that has passed since that particular event or moment.

> For example, "Not since high school have I played basketball" means that the person has not played basketball after they finished high school, highlighting the long period since they last played.

For many, the pandemic is merely ==an annoyance== . But some groups ==face a particular risk== of post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), the symptoms of which include nightmares, flashbacks and feelings of guilt, anxiety or isolation.The most vulnerable are those who have been very ill, or lost relatives, as well as victims of previous traumas(such as refugees), and those with front-line jobs, such as doctors and nurses. In Spain nearly a sixth of those infected are health-care workers, and most of them show signs of PTSD. In Bangladesh, where the incomes of poor people briefly fell by 80% when lockdowns were tight, 86% of people in one poll reported covid-19-related stress.

> sth is an annoyance means that it doesn't do a lot harm to your life.

第三段

Humans are resilient . ==Those who experience trauma mostly cope.== When their homes are destroyed by earthquakes, they rebuild them and carry on . Even the mass bombing of cities in the second world war did not break civilian morale. ==Nonetheless , the world should take the collective mental damage of covid-19 seriously== .Steps to reduce it cost little, and can benefit not only individuals but also society more broadly.

> resilient : able to quickly return to a previous good condition
> cope :  means you can handle it, manage it
> take sth seriously : you treated it as a serious issue

第四段

Research into previous disasters suggests that survivors' long-term mental health depends more on "perceived support " than "received support" . In other words, ==donations of money or food matter less than the feeling that you can turn to your neighbours for help==.Such help is typically offered ==spontaneously==, but governments can also ==chip in==. France ,for example, sets up "medical and psychological emergency units" after terrorist attacks and other disasters. ==These try to minimise the long-term mental-health consequences of such events by offering immediate walk-in psychological support near the site of the disaster==. Several cities in France have reactivated this "two-tent model" , one for medical care and the other for mental care, to help people cope with the toll of the virus.

> chip in : take part in
> "Chip in" is an informal phrasal verb that means to contribute or help with something, usually by providing money, effort, or resources as part of a group effort. It often implies that multiple people are working together or pooling their resources to achieve a common goal.

> For example, if a group of friends wants to buy a birthday gift for another friend, they might all "chip in" by contributing some money to purchase the gift together. Similarly, if a group of coworkers is organizing a potluck, they could each "chip in" by bringing a dish to share.

> toll of the virus : sufferings of the virus

Some people draw comfort from the fact that are not alone --millions are facing the same tribulations at the same time. ==But the pandemic also presents unusual challenges==. No one knows when it will end. Social distancing makes it harder to reconnect with others , a step in recovering from trauma. And the economic shock of covid -19 has undermined mental-health services everywhere , but especially in poor countries.

第六段

The most important measures will be local. ==A priority should be bring in people together by ,say ,expanding internet access.== Mutual-aid networks(eg,WhatsApp groups to deliver groceries to the elderly), which tend to ==peter out== once the initial disaster subsides, ==should instead be formalized and foucused on the most vulnerable==. Mental-health professionals should connect patients to such services, and train more lay folk as counselllors. In Zimbabwe, ==well before the pandemic==, hundreds of grandmothers were taught how to provide talk therapy on village benches to depressed  neighbours who could not afford to visit a distant clinic. Such innovations can work elsewhere ,too.


> A priority should be bring in people together by ,say ,expanding internet access : 
> A important thing should be .... 
> peter out : disappear 

> The word "instead" is an adverb used in English grammar to suggest an alternative or substitute in place of something that was originally mentioned or planned. It is used to propose a different action, thing, or way. 

> In your sentence, "You should instead be formalized and focused on the most vulnerable," the word "instead" is suggesting that rather than doing whatever was previously mentioned or implied, the person should be formalized and concentrate their efforts on the most vulnerable. It's indicating a change or shift in action or focus.

> 1. He was supposed to go on a vacation, but he had to work instead.
> 2. Instead of ordering pizza, they decided to cook dinner at home.
> 3. She was planning to go to the movies, but instead, she decided to stay home and read a book.

> well before: 
> 1. Well before the invention of smartphones, people relied on landlines and payphones for communication.
> 2. The company had identified the potential market trends well before their competitors, giving them a strategic advantage.

Religious services and sporting events can provide a physical or virtual space for mourning. The story of the pandemic can be taught in schools, ==helping== those for whom it was a hassle ==empathise with== those for whom it was life-changing. The mental trauma of covid-19 cannot be erased, but it can be eased.


> Yes, you're correct. The word "virtual" can have two seemingly opposite meanings depending on the context in which it's used.

1. In one sense, "virtual" is used to describe something that is so close to being something else that it can be considered as such. For example, if you say "he is the virtual leader of the team," it means he is not officially recognized as the leader, but he acts or is treated as if he is.

2. In a different context, particularly in technology, "virtual" refers to something that exists in cyberspace or is generated by a computer. This can be something that doesn't physically exist but appears to do so because of software. For instance, "virtual reality" is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.

>  So yes, "virtual" can mean something that is almost a reality or something that is not physically existing but made to appear so through software. The intended meaning depends on the context in which it's used.



> This sentence is suggesting that the events and experiences of the pandemic could be taught as a subject in schools. By doing so, it would help people who found the pandemic to be just a minor inconvenience ("a hassle") to better understand and empathize with those who experienced significant, life-altering changes as a result of the pandemic.

> Here's a breakdown of the sentence:
> 1. "The story of the pandemic can be taught in schools" - This part of the sentence proposes that the events and experiences of the pandemic could be included in educational curricula.
> 2. "helping those for whom it was a hassle" - This part refers to people who found the pandemic to be only a minor inconvenience, perhaps because it did not significantly impact their lives or routines.
> 3. "empathize with those for whom it was life-changing" - This part refers to people who experienced major changes in their lives due to the pandemic, such as losing a job, losing a loved one, or facing severe health issues.
> 
> So, the overall meaning of the sentence is that teaching the story of the pandemic in schools could help people who found it to be a minor inconvenience to better understand and empathize with those who experienced significant, life-altering changes as a result of the pandemic.
